## Motivation

Globally, violence undermines social and economic development, with its impacts 
being more pronounced in "developing" countries. Communities lacking adequate 
resources or experiencing systemic inequities are more vulnerable to various 
health challenges, including violence. Factors that influence health also play 
a role in shaping violence, which in turn affects determinants such as housing, 
education, transportation, and economic conditions. This project seeks to 
explore the factors driving serious assault, sexual violence, and intentional 
homicide worldwide from 2015 to 2023. 

We dplyr::selected this time frame because it includes significant global events, 
including the COVID-19 pandemic and various conflicts, which have greatly 
influenced patterns of violence. Also, even though there are a lot of missing 
data for year 2023, we decided to include the year because this time period 
provides insight into the contemporary factors shaping violence worldwide. 

Moreover, we modeled with both homicide rate and violence rate as our outcomes 
instead of just one because we can see a more nuanced understanding of the 
global violence landscape and real-world complexity of violence. 
These two outcomes represent different forms of violence with potentially 
different causes and implications. Though homicide and violence rate may be 
related, capture different dimension of violent behavior: homicide rate 
specifically measures the occurrence of fatal violence, such as murders, 
whereas violence rate focuses on a broader violence, including non-fatal ones. 
For example, assaults, sexual violences and armed conflicts.

## Initial Questions


(1) What are indicators of violence (which has most influence - answered by regression)?
(2) How do rates of both indicator and outcome differ by region/country?
