<h1 class="title toc-ignore"><strong>P8105 Final Project: Determinants
of Global Violence</strong></h1>
<h4 class="author">My An Huynh, Jeffrey Lin, Soo Min You, Hyun Kim,
Malika Top</h4>

</div>


<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1><em>Motivation</em></h1>
<p>Globally, violence undermines social and economic development, with
its impacts being more pronounced in “developing” countries. Communities
lacking adequate resources or experiencing systemic inequities are more
vulnerable to various health challenges, including violence. Factors
that influence health also play a role in shaping violence, which in
turn affects determinants such as housing, education, transportation,
and economic conditions. This project seeks to explore the factors
driving serious assault, sexual violence, and intentional homicide
worldwide from 2015 to 2023.</p>
<p>Selected this time frame because it includes significant global
events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and various conflicts, which
have greatly influenced patterns of violence. Also, even though there
are a lot of missing data for year 2023, we decided to include the year
because this time period provides insight into the contemporary factors
shaping violence worldwide.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level1">
<h1><em>Related Work</em></h1>
<p>Conflict trends in 2023 revealed increasing threats to the state of
global peace. New York Times (NYT) Journalist, Marc Lacey, titled NYT’s
annual photojournalism review <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/world/year-in-pictures.html">“A
Weary World”</a>. Though 2024 comes to a close , the conflicts in
Russia, Gaza, Ethiopia, and Sudan rage on, and more understanding of
violence trends is needed. Tensions within and across countries have
major implications for not just conflict prevention but also social and
economic preservation which are often more fragile in vulnerable
areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level1">
<h1><em>Initial Questions</em></h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How can we best predict violence and homicide rates (i.e. what are
its indicators)?</li>
<li>How do rates of indicators compare across global regions and
countries?</li>
<li>How do rates of violence and homicide compare across global and
regions and countries?</li>
<li>What categories of violent are most prevalent?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1><em>Data</em></h1>
<div id="source" class="section level2">
<h2>Source</h2>
<p>Since there are many determinants and indicators of violence, we
chose the indicators and outcomes that seem most relevant and
interesting in exploring violence from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>United Nations Development Program (UNDP):
<ul>
<li>Human Development Index</li>
</ul></li>
<li>United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
<ul>
<li>Corruption and Economic Crime</li>
<li>Criminal Justice Personnel</li>
<li>Human Trafficking</li>
<li>Intentional Homicide</li>
<li>Violent and Sexual Crimes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>World Bank
<ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</li>
<li>Inflation Rate (Measured by Consumer Price Index)</li>
<li>Unemployment Rate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>World Health Organization (WHO)
<ul>
<li>Alcohol Consumption</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Intentional homicide, and violent and sexual crimes were chosen as
the outcome variable to quantify violence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentional homicide:
<ul>
<li>counting unit: number of homicide victims per 100,000
population</li>
<li>classification:
<ul>
<li>situational context: organized crime, interpersonal (excluding
familial/intimate), socio-political</li>
<li>relationship to perpetrator: intimate partner, family member,
friend, colleague, etc.</li>
<li>mechanism: firearm, weapon, physical force</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Violent and sexual crimes:
<ul>
<li>counting unit: number of individual offences per 100,000
population</li>
<li>classification of offenses:
<ul>
<li>rape</li>
<li>serious assault</li>
<li>kidnapping</li>
<li>sexual violence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOTE: some countries used other counting unit (a series of offenses
to form a case, or multiple cases to form an investigation)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="scraping-method" class="section level2">
<h2>Scraping Method</h2>
<p>The datasets were downloaded from the official websites of the
sources above. The names of the files were also changed accordingly for
clarity and to avoid confusion. For example, the alcohol consumption
data file was renamed from “data.csv” to “alcohol_consumption.csv”.</p>
</div>
<div id="eda-data" class="section level2">
<h2>EDA Data</h2>
<p>For EDA, since we are interested in exploring the trends of global
violence, we imported and tidied the datasets for our two outcome
variables: homicide and violence.</p>
<div id="homicide" class="section level3">
<h3>Homicide</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>homicide_visual_df = 
    read_excel(path = &quot;data/unodc/intentional_homicide.xlsx&quot;,
               skip = 2) |&gt;

  filter(unit_of_measurement == &quot;Rate per 100,000 population&quot;,
         indicator == &quot;Victims of intentional homicide&quot;,
         category != &quot;Total&quot;,
         sex != &quot;Total&quot;,
         between(year, 2015, 2023)) |&gt;
  select(country, region, category, sex, year, 
         homicide_rate = value) |&gt;
  mutate(category = str_replace_all(category, 
                                    &quot;^Intimate partner or family member.*&quot;, 
                                    &quot;Intimate partner or family member&quot;),
         category = str_replace_all(category, 
                                    &quot;^Socio-political homicide.*&quot;, 
                                    &quot;Socio-political homicide&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>The tidied homicide dataset includes country, region, category of
homicide victims, sex, year and victim rate of homicide. The dataset
included data for both counts and rates per 100,000 people. Therefore,
we filtered to choose rates per 100,000 people since it allows
standardization for comparability by adjusting for differences in
population size.</p>
</div>
<div id="violence" class="section level3">
<h3>Violence</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>violence_visual_df = 
    read_excel(path = &quot;data/unodc/violent_sexual_crime.xlsx&quot;,
               skip = 2) |&gt;
  janitor::clean_names() |&gt;
  filter(unit_of_measurement == &quot;Rate per 100,000 population&quot;,
         between(year, 2015, 2023)) |&gt;
  select(country, region, indicator, category, sex, year, 
         violence_rate = value) |&gt;
  mutate(category = str_replace_all(category, 
                                    &quot;^Sexual violence.*&quot;, 
                                    &quot;Sexual violence&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>The tidied violence dataset includes country, region, indicator,
category of violence, sex, year and violence rate. The indicator
includes different rates for violence (violent offences and victims)
which are explored further in EDA. Rates per 100,000 people were chosen
also for this dataset for comparability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="regression-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Regression Data</h2>
<p>For regression, the datasets for all the chosen predictors and
outcomes are tidied and merged for modeling process and analysis.</p>
<div id="function-to-tidy-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3>Function to Tidy Datasets</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_df = function(data, variable, pivot = FALSE, average = FALSE) {
  
  if(pivot) {
    data = data |&gt;
      pivot_longer(cols = -iso3_code,
                   names_to = &quot;year&quot;,
                   values_to = variable) |&gt;
      janitor::clean_names()
  }
  
  data = data |&gt;
    mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
           iso3_code = str_replace_all(iso3_code, &quot;^GBR.*&quot;, &quot;GBR&quot;),
           iso3_code = str_replace_all(iso3_code, &quot;^IRQ.*&quot;, &quot;IRQ&quot;),
           country = countrycode(iso3_code, origin = &quot;iso3c&quot;,
                                 destination = &quot;country.name&quot;,
                                 nomatch = NA, warn = FALSE)) |&gt; 
    drop_na(country)
  
  if(average) {
    
    if(&quot;region&quot; %in% colnames(data)) {
      data = data |&gt;
        group_by( country, region, year) |&gt;
        summarize(!!variable := mean(value))
    }
    
    else {
        data = data |&gt;
          group_by(country, year) |&gt;
          summarize(!!variable := mean(value))
    }
    
  }
  
  return(data)
  
}</code></pre>
<p>We defined a function <code>tidy_df()</code>to pipe after importing
each dataset to automatically tidy the datasets. The
<code>countrycode()</code> function standardizes the country names of
each dataset since some of the country names are represented
inconsistently across dataset files. For example, South Korea was
represented as “Korea (Republic of)” and “Korea, Rep.”</p>
<p>Moreover, for the countrycode() function, NA is returned if no
matches are found and warnings are also suppressed by
<code>nomatch = NA</code> and <code>warn = FALSE</code> respectively
since some datasets include iso3 codes for entities that are not
countries. For example, EUU represents the European Union; however, the
<code>countrycode()</code> function only recognizes iso3 codes for
countries and returns a warning, but we are interested in countries and
regions. A boolean parameter called <code>pivot</code> was included to
indicate if a dataset needs to be pivoted and subsequently perform
<code>pivot_longer()</code>, since some datasets had years organized as
different columns, where each column represented values for that
year.</p>
<p>Also, some of the datasets include rates for different categories.
For example, the data for economic crime includes crime rates for fraud,
burglary and more. Therefore, another boolean parameter called
<code>average</code> was included to pass an option to group by and
summarize rates across categories and genders of different datasets, in
order to provide a standardized measure and reduce complexity for
analysis.</p>

<li><code>unemployment</code></li>
<li><code>human development index</code></li>

different years as data columns, which needs to be pivoted
accordingly.</p>

provided data for number of human trafficking victims, instead of
trafficking rates; the dataset also included a category for total number
of trafficking victims, so the data was filtered for total category and
neither the <code>pivot</code> nor <code>average</code> options were set
to true in the <code>tidy_df()</code> function.</p>

higher homicide rates for most categories compared to Asia. Homicides of
perpetrator to victim relationship unknown has the largest homicide
rate. Homicides of unknown types is next category with the highest
homicide rate in the Americas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Asia has a significantly high homicide rate in
socio-political homicide compared to the other categories,suggesting
high casualties as a result of socio-political activities for countries
in Asia. The other categories have a homicide rate lesser than 5
percent.</p>

<p>Homicides of unknown types and perpetrator to victim relationship
unknown are two highest proportions in the total homicide rate,
indicating most homicides are committed by strangers or have no
connection with the victims. Also, we can observe that homicide rates as
a result of organized criminal groups or gangs and interpersonal
homicide are the next significant proportions in homicide. The total
homicide rate increases sharply from 2015 to 2017 compared to the other
years possibly due to socioeconomic factors, such as economic
instability.</p>

where the rate for females have been sharply increasing over the years.
The victim rate for the Americas and Europe has also been increasing,
but steadily compared to Oceania over the years, while Asia has
experienced a decline from 2019. Africa was not included because the

<div id="global-prevalence-of-violence" class="section level2">
<h2>Global Prevalence of Violence</h2>
<p>Across the time period from 2015 to 2023, the Americas consistently
exhibited a significantly higher homicide rate compared to other
regions. The difference in this region is pronounced, indicating a
persistent and widespread issue with violent crime. The homicide rate in
Asia is also notable. There was a rising trend in homicide rate from
2015 to 2021, but was followed by a sharp decrease in 2022. However, it
should be noted that not all countries that reported homicide rate also
reported the violence rate.</p>
<p>The drop in 2022 may imply that there was a potential shift or
improvement in the region, but it could also mean that there are some
missing data in that year, leading a bias or misinterpretation. When
examining violence rates, the Americas followed a similar trend to the
homicide rate, with rates significantly higher than the other regions.
This trend reflects the persistent issue of violence in the region,
affecting not only homicide rates but also broader forms of violence.
However, Oceania presented an extreme outlier in terms of victim rates
of sexual violence, surpassing even the Americas.</p>
<p>Putting these results against our own knowledge, Oceania’s rates seem
higher than expected. This raises the question of if higher rates mean
more violent countries or countries who just have reported more crimes.
It is very important to address that these outcome data are compiled by
UNODC but the data itself comes from each nation’s respective
administrative registers, often managed by law enforcement agencies.
Additionally, UNODC comes by this data not through requirement but by
the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal
Justice Systems (UN-CTS). This means that countries voluntarily supply
their information. However, a safety-guard is that UNODC does check for
consistency and coherence with other data sources.</p>
